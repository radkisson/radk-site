**Q. Do you think fast food is bad?**  
  
A. Y_es, I do. If it is eaten too often, it can cause problems **such as** heart disease or diabetes. **Also**, it can lead to weight problems which are really common nowadays._  
  
> **Comments:** You could use “such as” or “for example” in this sentence because the content is more serious. Please note that we don’t use “furthermore” or “in addition” for speaking, instead we use “also” or “and”.  
  
**Q. Do children play similar games today that they played in the past?**  
  
*A. No, I don’t think they do. **Before**, children used to play simple games **like** hide and seek **or** they used to play with simple handmade toys. **But,** **these days**, kids tend to prefer computer games **and** their toys are battery operated.*
